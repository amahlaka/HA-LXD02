"""Make BlueZ connect to the printer over Bluetooth LE, not classic BR/EDR.

Copied from the wp9529 integration, where it was needed: a printer that
advertises the "BR/EDR supported" flag is treated by BlueZ as a dual-mode
device. BlueZ then updates the last-seen time of both bearers from
each advertisement, and breaks the tie in favour of BR/EDR, where the printer
offers nothing: Connect() fails with org.bluez.Error.BREDR.ProfileUnavailable.

BlueZ's fix is the Device1.PreferredBearer property. It is experimental, but
Home Assistant OS runs bluetoothd with --experimental (passive scanning needs
it). The property only exists for dual-mode devices and only on BlueZ, so this
is a no-op for ESPHome Bluetooth proxies, other OSes and LE-only devices.
